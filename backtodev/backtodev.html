        <h1>Why am I getting back to development?</h1>
        <p>So, its been a while since I stopped coding and focussed more on Sales, People and Project management. 
          Over time I've lost touch with programming and believe that I need to get back.</p>
        <p>So I'll be chronicling my journey on this page. To start with, I'll be focussing on completing <a href="www.freecodecamp.org">www.freecodecamp.org</a>, and will be logging my daily progress on this page.</p>
        <p>I've already completed the first of the six certifications on freecodecamp.org, which is the Responsive Web Design certification. 
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ggupta78/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">Here's</a> my certificate, and which is also why I'm currently trying to build this website using plain HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>I've started the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certification, and I'll capture its progress here.</p>
        <h2>Updates:</h2>

          <h4>23rd July 2019</h4>
          <p>
            ES6 Concepts -<br/>
            Destructuring variables from objects, nested objects and arrays<br/>
            Destructuring to re-assign array elements<br/>
            Destructuring objects as function parameters.<br/>
            String template literals - ${}<br/>
            Class and constructors, getters and setters<br/>
            import { function } from 'path to file'<br/>
            import * as obj from 'path to file'<br/>
            export { var, function }<br/>
            default export and import (for only functions) and import does not have curly braces<br/>
          </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>23rd July 2019</h4>
          <p>Arrays - push, pop, shift, unshift<br/>
            Functions - Global and Local declaration. Declaring a variable without using var makes it global.<br/>
            Equality and Strict Equality operators ==, ===, != and !=== <br/>
            &lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, &lt;=<br/>
            if-else, else-if<br/>
            switch-case, case comparison is done using strict Equality operator!<br/>
            Object notation - dot, ['prop'], delete obj.prop <br/>
            Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min <br/>
            parseInt(num, radix), e.g. parseInt("01", 2) = 1 <br/>
            ES6 Concepts:<br/>
            let vs const<br/>
            Arrow functions, including map(), filter() and reduce()<br/>
            Default parameters<br/>
            Rest and Spread ... operator<br/>
           </p>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>22nd July 2019</h4>
          <p>Spent a couple of hours fixing the css of the Minimal theme I'm using to covert it into a single column layout. 
            Created a new css file, imported the old one and overrode the header, section and footer css. 
            Had thought of using Gatsby to generate my site. But I guess I'll take that up later.</p>
