        <h1>Why am I getting back to development?</h1>
        <p>So, its been a while since I stopped coding and focussed more on Sales, People and Project management. 
          Over time I've lost touch with programming and believe that I need to get back.</p>
        <p>So I'll be chronicling my journey on this page. To start with, I'll be focussing on completing <a href="www.freecodecamp.org">www.freecodecamp.org</a>, and will be logging my daily progress on this page.</p>
        <p>I've already completed the first of the six certifications on freecodecamp.org, which is the Responsive Web Design certification. 
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/ggupta78/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">Here's</a> my certificate, and which is also why I'm currently trying to build this website using plain HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>I've started the Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures certification, and I'll capture its progress here.</p>
