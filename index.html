	<h2>What do I do?</h2>
	<p>
		I work as a Solution Architect for this great company called <a href="http://www.quovantis.com">Quovantis</a>,
		which is a group of like-minded coders, builders and dreamers based in Delhi, India. And who love to build beautiful software.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most of my last 14 years have been spent working on the Microsoft .Net stack, and now I'm learning about mobile application development and moving into a leadership role.
		<br/><br/>
		I've worked on various enterprise oriented applications, and have strong skills in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
		<br/><br/>
		I have extensive experience in supporting large scale mission-critical services with greater than 99% uptime, serving from thousands to millions of users.
		<br/><br/>
		I have excellent communication skills and am extremely comfortable working with and managing distributed teams for more than 6 years now.
	</p>

	<h2>What do I dream of?</h2>
	<p>
		I dream of building video games. I used to love graphics programming in BASIC and C while I was studying.
		<br/>
		But then life and career happened, and I did not follow my interest in graphics programming.
		<br/>
		However, I've now started working towards learning games and graphics programming.
